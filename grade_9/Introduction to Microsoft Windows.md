# Introduction to Microsoft Windows

What is Windows?
This is an operating system and Graphical User Interface (GUI) created by Microsoft and found on most computer systems (but not all!). It allows for easy “point and click” operations between the user and the different files and programs with which they wish to work. There are many different versions of Windows, the fundamentals are the same, for instance Windows 8, Windows 7 and Windows XP
Features of Windows

1. The “Desktop”
This is the general work area of your computer. It gives you access to programs, folders and documents that you use frequently.
This area is customizable on your own computer, though it is not something that can be changed on a public computer at the library
2. An icon is a symbol/picture that acts as a button to open up a folder, document, application or other object. All icons need to be double clicked in order to open
You double click on the icon to execute the program.
Icons Vs Programs
When inside of the program, you single click on the commands or icons for that program. (Examples: MS Office, Internet Explorer, Firefox, Windows Media Player, etc.)
Application Icons open up a program (an executable file), like Internet Explorer, Microsoft Word, etc.
Folder Icons store and organize documents and applications. Often you will find folders within folders.
Document icons represent a specific file, like a word document, picture, etc. These files typically have an association with the program that is used to open them.
3. The taskbar is what you see at the very bottom of your screen. Contains the “Start” button, which allows access to other Windows programs and features that are not on the desktop.
4. System tray shows programs running in the background, the clock, volume control, etc.

5. Start Clicking on the “Start” button (not accessible on public library computers) will give you access to settings, help, other programs and documents and many other features.
