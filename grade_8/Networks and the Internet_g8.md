## COMPUTER NETWORKS

#### What a computer network?
Computer network is a link between two or more computers or an interconnection of computers for purposes of sharing resources. E.g. computer 1 + computer 2 + computer 3= computer network.

### Computer Network Terminologies
#### 1. Stand-alone Computer.
 A computer which is not connected to another computer is called? -A stand-alone computer.
#### 2. Server.
A central computer that hold data/information and able to feed other computers on a network is called -A server or Host
#### 3. Terminals/Workstation/Clients.
The computers connected to the server or host are called?
– Terminals or workstations or slaves or clients
#### 4. Internet
* An internet is a link between two or more computer networks or an interconnection of computers networks. E.g. computer network + computer network + computer network= Internet
What is the difference between a computer network and internet?
* The difference between a computer network and internet is that a computer network is the interconnection of two or more computers and this can be within a room or city while an internet is the interconnection of computer networks, and this can cover networks of the whole country or the world.
#### Purpose of the internet
• To share data
– For example, a centralized database can be used to store all the records of an organization and the same data in the database can be accessed by everyone.
* To share tasks
 A team of workers can work together on tasks to speed up processing.
 * To share computer resources
– Expensive resources, such as hard disks, printers and software programs can be shared. Sharing these resources greatly reduces procurement and maintenance costs.
* To make communication more efficient and effective
– It is easier and cheaper for people to communicate.
What are the three main function of an internet? The three main functions of the Internet are:
* Communication
– One can contact and exchange information with friends and organizations anywhere in the world.
* Retrieval of information
– One can have access to a broad range of data and information from other computers around the globe.
* Commerce
– One can advertise, buy and sell goods and services on the Internet.
Mention three types of computer networks. These are;
– Local Area Network (LAN)
– Metropolitan Area Network (MAN)
– Wide Area Network (WAN)
The three mentioned types of computer networks they differ due to the area they cover.
* Local Area Network (LAN) - A LAN is a computer network within a room, a building or a small area such as a school campus. Computers in a LAN are separated by distances of up to a few kilometers. An example of a LAN is the Chinsali day secondary school computer lab.
* Metropolitan Area Network (MAN) - MAN is a computer network within a town or district. It covers a longer distance than a LAN. An example of MAN is the computer network used to connect branches of a bank within a town.
* Wide Area Network (WAN) -WAN connect computers separated by longer distances, for example in different towns, in different countries or different continents. An example of a WAN is the Internet which interconnects many computer networks in the world.
Compare and contrast the three types of computer networks (LAN, MAN and WAN)
