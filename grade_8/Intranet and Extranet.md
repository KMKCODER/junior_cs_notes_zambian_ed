### INTRANET VS EXTRANET NOTES
#### Definitions.
#### Intranet 
An intranet is a private computer network within an organization that uses internet protocols and technologies but is securely isolated from the public internet. 
- It serves as a closed network accessible only to the organization's internal employees or members. 
- The primary purpose of an intranet is to facilitate internal communication, collaboration, and the sharing of information and resources among employees. 
- It typically includes tools for document management, employee directories, announcements, and other internal services. An example of an institution using an intranet is a bank.
#### Extranet 
- An extranet is an extension of an organization's intranet that allows controlled access to specific external users. It provides a secure and restricted network environment for collaboration between an organization and its external partners, suppliers, clients, or other stakeholders. Extranets use the same technologies as the internet but with additional security measures. The purpose of an extranet is to enable secure communication, document sharing, and collaboration beyond the organization's boundaries while maintaining confidentiality and access controls. External users granted access to the extranet typically have limited and specific privileges. An example is educational institutions, often they use extranets to collaborate with external researchers, partner institutions, or industry partners on joint projects, research initiatives, and academic programs.
